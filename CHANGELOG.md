# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Remove legacy `MainActivity` from the launcher module after eliminating its layout binding.
- Replace the Web app's `next.config.ts` with an equivalent `next.config.js` for compatibility with tooling expecting JavaScript configs.
- Inline the Web project's TypeScript defaults to remove the missing `next/core-web-vitals` preset dependency.
- Resolve CTA button prop typing to keep Next.js builds passing under strict union checks.
- Replace analytics fallback logging with an in-browser debug event buffer to satisfy linting.
